        <h2>Senior at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance.</p>
         <p>
            I am extremely passionate about sports, society, and my church. I've played nearly every sport growing up and follow nearly every one to some extent. I am apart of the Chi Alpha Pi Cavaliers here at school and am blessed enough to be their President this semester. I also attend Calvary Baptist Church in Simpsonville where I serve as an usher and help with kids.
